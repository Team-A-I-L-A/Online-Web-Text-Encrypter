# Online Web Text Encrypter - HTML, CSS y Javascript 🔐🔠
This repository stores all the resources and codes made in HTML, CSS and Javascript for the front-end and back-end operation of a website that encrypts text with 5 different algorithms (one algorithm is the one proposed by Alura). This was originally done as a challenge proposed by Alura in the ORACLE Next Education program.

* **[scripts]**: This folder contains all the codes made in javascript for the operation of the web and the encryption algorithms.


## Main Files description 📘

* **[index.html]**: This file is the visual skeleton of the main web page and the pop-up configuration, establishing the primitive elements and the use of styles and scripts.

* **[style-index.css]**: This file sets the style for all elements of the main page and the pop-up configuration.

* **[reset.css]**: This file resets the style before applying the "style-index.css" house style. This is necessary because browsers apply certain styles by default.

* **[script-index.js]**: This file contains the logic for the "encrypt", "decrypt", "copy" and configuration buttons. It also calls the encryption scripts.

* **[cifrado_???.js]**: These files contain the respective encryption algorithm (algorithm: "????").
